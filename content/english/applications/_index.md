## Where Spatial AI Creates Value

When AI understands 3D space, it can participate in the physical world—designing, optimizing, and controlling systems that exist in three dimensions.

## Application Areas

### [Robotics & Automation](/applications/robotics)
Spatial reasoning for the machines that will shape our world. Path planning, assembly operations, and autonomous navigation.

### [Simulation & Training](/applications/simulation)
Where AI learns to understand and create in three dimensions. Virtual environments for training spatial intelligence.

### [Digital Twins](/applications/digital-twins)
Bridge design and reality. Live data, predictive intelligence, facility management with spatial context.

### [Manufacturing](/applications/manufacturing)
From design to fabrication with AI that understands constraints. Production planning, quality control, assembly documentation.

### [Construction](/applications/construction)
Modular, prefabricated, intelligent building design. Real-time collaboration for distributed teams.
