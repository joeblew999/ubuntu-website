## IoT Fleet Solutions

Deploy autonomous fleets—**drones, vehicles, building systems, industrial equipment**—with **onboard AI** for real-time decisions and **cloud AI** for fleet-wide intelligence. The architecture is device-agnostic: same patterns for aerial, ground, and fixed IoT.

| Fleet Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Aerial** | Drones, UAVs, inspection aircraft |
| **Ground Vehicles** | Trucks, AGVs, forklifts, tractors |
| **Building IoT** | HVAC, access control, sensors, meters |
| **Industrial** | Manufacturing equipment, robotics, conveyors |

All device types share the same architecture: edge AI, NATS JetStream messaging, digital twins, and unified fleet management. The pages below show how this applies to specific industries.

---

### [Agriculture & Farming]({{< relref "/applications/fleet-agriculture" >}})
Precision agriculture at scale. Crop monitoring, pest detection, and variable-rate spraying with AI that understands your fields.

### [Construction & Infrastructure]({{< relref "/applications/fleet-construction" >}})
Site surveys, progress tracking, and infrastructure inspection. Digital twin comparison with real-world conditions.

### [Public Safety & Emergency]({{< relref "/applications/fleet-safety" >}})
Search and rescue, disaster response, and situational awareness. Thermal imaging, person detection, and coordinated response.

### [Logistics & Delivery]({{< relref "/applications/fleet-logistics" >}})
Last-mile delivery, warehouse operations, and inventory management. Autonomous navigation with fleet-wide optimization.

### [Energy & Utilities]({{< relref "/applications/fleet-energy" >}})
Power line inspection, solar panel analysis, and pipeline monitoring. Detect defects before they become failures.

### [Mining & Resources]({{< relref "/applications/fleet-mining" >}})
Stockpile measurement, site surveying, and safety monitoring. Accurate volume calculations and progress tracking.

### [Environmental Monitoring]({{< relref "/applications/fleet-environment" >}})
Wildlife surveys, pollution detection, and forestry management. Long-term trend analysis with automated compliance reporting.

## The AI Advantage

Every IoT fleet solution combines two AI layers:

| Layer | Location | Capability |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Edge AI** | On-device (Jetson, Pi, embedded) | Real-time inference, object detection, immediate decisions without connectivity |
| **Cloud AI** | NATS JetStream backend | Fleet-wide analytics, historical trends, predictive maintenance, coordination |

Edge processing handles the millisecond decisions. Cloud processing handles the fleet-wide intelligence. Same pattern whether the device is airborne, on wheels, or bolted to a wall.

## Enterprise Platforms

Beyond drone fleets, we provide document and data management for regulated industries.

---

### [Manufacturing]({{< relref "/applications/manufacturing" >}})
From design to fabrication with AI that understands production constraints. CAM integration, process planning, quality tracking.

### [Robotics & Simulation]({{< relref "/applications/robotics" >}})
Spatial reasoning for robots. Work cell design, path planning, and simulation-to-reality pipelines.

### [Financial Services]({{< relref "/applications/financial" >}})
Compliance without complexity. Loan applications, disclosures, regulatory documentation with complete audit trails.

### [Government & Public Sector]({{< relref "/applications/government" >}})
Serve every citizen. Paper and digital unified. Accessible formats, archival compliance, legacy system integration.

### [Healthcare]({{< relref "/applications/healthcare" >}})
Less administration, fewer errors, better care. Patient intake, consent management, EMR integration.

### [Education]({{< relref "/applications/education" >}})
Modern administration, traditional options. Enrollment, permissions, student records—paper and portal unified.

### [Insurance]({{< relref "/applications/insurance" >}})
Every channel, one system. Field agents, online customers, mailed claims—all processed uniformly.
