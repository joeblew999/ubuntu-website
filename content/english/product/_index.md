## Introducing Our AI-Powered CAD Platform

We're building the next generation of computer-aided design software for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. A modern 2D/3D CAD system that combines the precision of traditional CAD tools with the intelligence of AI—purpose-built for prefabricated modular construction.

---

## The Problem

The AEC industry is undergoing a transformation toward prefabricated modular housing. Factory-built modules offer faster construction, better quality control, and reduced waste. But traditional CAD software wasn't designed for this workflow:

- **File-based collaboration** breaks down when multiple teams work on interconnected modules
- **Proprietary formats** create vendor lock-in and interoperability nightmares
- **No real-time sync** means teams waste hours merging conflicting changes
- **Legacy architectures** can't integrate modern AI assistance

Modular construction demands a new approach—CAD software built from the ground up for distributed teams, open standards, and intelligent automation.

## Our Solution

### 100% Open Standards

No proprietary lock-in. Your designs belong to you.

- **STEP Format** - Industry-standard 3D geometry exchange (ISO 10303)
- **IFC Support** - Native Building Information Modeling interoperability (ISO 16739)
- **Open File Formats** - Export to any compatible system without conversion loss
- **Future-Proof** - Your data remains accessible regardless of software changes

---

### Real-Time Collaboration

Remote teams working together as if in the same room.

- **True Real-Time Sync** - See changes from teammates instantly, not after save-merge-commit cycles
- **Automerge-Powered** - Conflict-free collaboration using CRDT technology
- **Distributed Teams** - Factory floor in Thailand, engineering in Germany, architects in Australia—all working on the same model simultaneously
- **Offline-First** - Work without internet, sync automatically when reconnected
- **Complete Version History** - Full revision control with branching and merging

---

### Built for Modular Construction

Designed specifically for prefabricated housing factories.

- **Module-Centric Design** - First-class support for prefab module workflows
- **Factory Integration** - Connect designs directly to manufacturing systems
- **Assembly Sequencing** - Plan and visualize module installation order
- **Tolerance Management** - Handle the precision requirements of factory production
- **Transport Planning** - Consider logistics constraints in the design phase

---

### AI-Powered Assistance

Your intelligent design partner powered by modern AI.

- **MCP Integration** - Built on the Model Context Protocol for seamless AI tool integration
- **Natural Language Commands** - Describe what you want to create or modify in plain language
- **Design Optimization** - AI suggestions for manufacturability, cost, and performance
- **Error Detection** - Automatic identification of design issues before they become problems
- **Conversational Interface** - Chat with your CAD system about your designs

---

### Digital Twin & IoT

Bridge the gap between design and the real world. Our approach to facility management is informed by real-world experience—including work on AI-powered facility management systems with [Bilfinger](https://www.bilfinger.com/), one of Germany's leading engineering and services companies.

- **Digital Twin Simulation** - Run simulations using NATS JetStream messaging
- **Facility Management** - Manage IoT devices and sensors in completed buildings

- **Hybrid Approach** - Keep sensitive work local while leveraging cloud for collaboration
- **Self-Hosted** - Deploy on your own infrastructure for complete control

---

## Why Now?

The convergence of several technologies makes this the right time:

1. **CRDTs mature** - Automerge and similar libraries enable true real-time collaboration
2. **AI becomes practical** - Large language models can now assist with complex design tasks
3. **Open standards gain adoption** - IFC and STEP are increasingly accepted across the industry
4. **Modular construction grows** - The market demands tools built for this workflow
5. **Web technology advances** - WebAssembly and modern browsers enable desktop-class performance

---

## Current Status

We're actively developing the platform with a focus on:

1. **Core CAD Engine** - Building a robust foundation for 2D/3D solid modeling with STEP/IFC
2. **Real-Time Collaboration** - Automerge-based sync for distributed teams
3. **AI Integration** - MCP-based AI assistance throughout the workflow
4. **Digital Twin** - NATS JetStream-powered simulation and IoT connectivity
5. **Cross-Platform** - Web, desktop, and mobile interfaces via webview
