## Let's Build Together

We're building the platform where AI designs reality. If you're working in the same space, we want to hear from you.

---

## Who We Want to Hear From

**Robotics teams** — Building humanoids, warehouse automation, surgical systems, or any robot that needs to understand space.

**Simulation engineers** — Creating training environments for AI, synthetic data pipelines, or digital worlds for embodied intelligence.

**Facility managers** — Running buildings, factories, or infrastructure where digital twins could transform operations.

**Manufacturers** — From job shops to OEMs, anyone bridging the gap between design and production.

**Construction innovators** — Modular builders, prefab manufacturers, and anyone pushing construction toward factory precision.

**Potential partners** — Robot OEMs, simulation platforms, sensor companies, or anyone whose technology fits the ecosystem.

**Investors** — If you see the same convergence we do.

## What to Include

Help us understand how we might work together:

- **Who you are** — Your role and organization
- **What you're building** — The problem you're solving
- **Where AI + 3D matters** — How spatial intelligence fits your work
- **What you're looking for** — Early access, partnership, conversation
