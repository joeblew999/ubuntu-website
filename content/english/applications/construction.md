## Building the Future, Factory First

Construction is transforming. The chaos of the job site is moving to the precision of the factory. Modules built in controlled environments, shipped complete, assembled on site in days instead of months.

But the tools haven't caught up. Traditional CAD was designed for traditional construction. File-based. Siloed. Disconnected from manufacturing reality.

Modular construction demands something new.

---

## The Shift

Construction is becoming manufacturing.

**Traditional construction:**
- Build on site, exposed to weather
- Every project unique, every problem new
- Sequential trades, waiting on each other
- Quality varies with conditions and crews
- Waste measured in dumpsters

**Modular construction:**
- Build in factory, controlled environment
- Repeatable processes, learned improvements
- Parallel production, compressed schedules
- Consistent quality, factory precision
- Waste measured and minimized

**The industry is moving. The software must follow.**

---

## The Problem

Today's CAD wasn't built for this:

**File-based collaboration breaks down.** When the factory in Vietnam, structural engineers in Germany, and architects in Australia all need to work on interconnected modules—emailing files doesn't scale.

**No manufacturing integration.** Traditional CAD produces drawings. Factories need data. The translation is manual, error-prone, expensive.

**Proprietary formats create friction.** Every stakeholder uses different software. Every handoff loses information. Interoperability is a constant battle.

**AI can't help.** Legacy architectures weren't built for intelligence. AI assistance is bolted on, not built in.

**The result:** Modular construction's promise—speed, quality, efficiency—undermined by tools designed for a different era.

## What We Enable

### Real-Time Collaboration

Distributed teams working as one.

**Automerge CRDT** synchronization means:

- Factory floor in Vietnam sees design changes instantly
- Engineers in Germany and architects in Australia on the same model
- No file versions. No merge conflicts. No "which one is current?"
- Changes visible in real-time, not after save-merge-commit cycles

**Offline-first architecture:**

- Factory floor works without reliable internet
- Design office works on planes and remote sites
- Everything syncs automatically when reconnected
- Full version history preserved

**Global teams. Local performance.**

---

### Module-Centric Design

First-class support for how modular actually works.

- **Module as unit** — Design, track, and manage at the module level
- **Interface management** — Connections between modules explicit and validated
- **Variant handling** — Base designs with configurable options
- **Assembly sequencing** — Plan installation order during design
- **Transport constraints** — Size, weight, lifting points considered from the start

**Not buildings chopped into pieces. Modules designed as modules.**

---

### Factory Integration

Design connected to production.

- **Manufacturing data export** — Not drawings. Data. BOM, cut lists, assembly sequences.
- **CNC integration** — Panel saws, CNC routers, automated lines fed directly
- **Production planning** — Module schedules linked to factory capacity
- **Quality checkpoints** — Inspection requirements embedded in the model

**Design what the factory can build. Build what was designed.**

---

### AI-Powered Design

Intelligence throughout the workflow.

**Model Context Protocol** integration enables:

- **Natural language interaction** — "Add a bathroom module to the east wing"
- **Design optimization** — AI suggestions for manufacturability, cost, performance
- **Clash detection** — Automatic identification of conflicts before they're problems
- **Code compliance** — Regulations checked continuously, not at submission
- **Cost estimation** — Design changes reflected in budget in real-time

**AI that understands buildings, not just geometry.**

---

### Open Standards

No lock-in. Full interoperability. Future-proof.

**IFC (ISO 16739)** — Native Building Information Modeling. Full semantic richness. Spaces, systems, materials, properties. Not just shapes—meaning.

**STEP (ISO 10303)** — Precision geometry exchange. The format manufacturing trusts.

**Open export** — Work with any compliant system. Hand off to any stakeholder. Archive with confidence.

**Your designs belong to you. Forever.**

---

### Site to Factory to Site

The full loop connected.

```
Site Survey    →    Design    →    Factory    →    Transport    →    Assembly
     ↑                                                                    │
     └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              Continuous feedback
```

- **Reality capture** — Scan sites, bring into the model
- **Design in context** — Modules designed for actual site conditions
- **Factory production** — Manufacturing data flows seamlessly
- **Logistics planning** — Transport routing, crane positioning, sequence
- **Assembly guidance** — Installation instructions from the model
- **As-built capture** — What was installed feeds back to documentation

**No information gaps. No re-entry. No translation loss.**

## For Manufacturers

Building modules in your factory.

- **Design for your capabilities** — Constraints understood from the start
- **Direct data integration** — No manual translation to production
- **Collaboration with designers** — Real-time, not through RFIs
- **Quality documentation** — Built into the model, not added after

**Produce what was designed. Efficiently.**

---

## For Architects

Design that manufactures.

- **Manufacturability feedback** — Know if it can be built as you design
- **Real-time collaboration** — Work with engineers and factories simultaneously
- **Variant exploration** — Options without redrawing everything
- **Open formats** — Hand off without format wars

**Design intent preserved through production.**

---

## For Developers

Speed. Cost certainty. Quality.

- **Faster schedules** — Factory production parallels site preparation
- **Budget confidence** — Manufacturing costs more predictable than site construction
- **Quality assurance** — Factory conditions beat site conditions
- **Reduced risk** — Fewer unknowns, better outcomes

**Modular's promise, actually delivered.**

---

## For Engineers

Structure, MEP, coordination.

- **Integrated coordination** — All disciplines in one model, real-time
- **Clash detection** — Conflicts caught in design, not on site
- **Module interface validation** — Connections verified automatically
- **Manufacturing coordination** — Engineering connected to production

**Engineering for manufacturing, not just construction.**

---

## The Opportunity

Modular construction is growing globally:

- Housing shortages demand faster delivery
- Labor constraints push toward factory efficiency
- Quality expectations rising
- Sustainability requirements tightening
- Cost pressures intensifying

**The industry needs tools built for where it's going, not where it's been.**
