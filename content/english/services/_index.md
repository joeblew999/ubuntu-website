## What I Do

I help organizations solve complex technical challenges. Whether you're scaling infrastructure, modernizing legacy systems, or building new platforms from scratch, I bring 25+ years of hands-on experience to deliver results.

## Core Services

### Software Architecture & Design

Building systems that scale and last.

- **Greenfield Architecture** - Design new systems with the right foundations from day one
- **Legacy Modernization** - Incremental strategies to evolve monoliths into maintainable services
- **Technical Due Diligence** - Architecture assessments for acquisitions, investments, or major initiatives
- **Performance Optimization** - Identify bottlenecks and implement targeted improvements

*Recent example: Designed distributed architecture handling 50M+ daily transactions for government healthcare system.*

---

### Kubernetes & Cloud Infrastructure

Production-grade container orchestration and cloud platforms.

- **Kubernetes at Scale** - Multi-cluster deployments, service mesh, GitOps workflows
- **Cloud Migration** - AWS, GCP, Azure - strategy through implementation
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform, Pulumi, reproducible environments
- **Cost Optimization** - Right-sizing, reserved capacity planning, waste elimination

*Recent example: Deployed and managed 7,000+ Kubernetes servers for Metro AG retail operations.*

---

### Distributed Systems & Real-Time

High-performance systems that handle complexity.

- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Kafka, NATS, event sourcing, CQRS
- **Real-Time Processing** - Sub-millisecond latency for trading, IoT, autonomous systems
- **Data Pipelines** - Streaming architectures, batch processing, data mesh
- **Reliability Engineering** - Chaos engineering, disaster recovery, SLO/SLA design

*Recent example: Built real-time coordination system for autonomous transport vehicles at Audi AG.*

---

### Go & Backend Development

Modern backend systems in Go and related technologies.

- **Go Development** - Microservices, APIs, CLI tools, system utilities
- **API Design** - REST, gRPC, GraphQL - pragmatic choices for your needs
- **Database Architecture** - PostgreSQL, Redis, time-series, graph databases
- **Integration** - Third-party APIs, legacy system bridges, data synchronization

*Primary language for the past 8+ years. Contributor to Go ecosystem and tooling.*

---

### Technical Leadership

Helping teams and organizations level up.

- **Architecture Reviews** - Structured assessment with actionable recommendations
- **Team Mentoring** - Hands-on guidance for engineering teams (led teams up to 70 developers)
- **Process Improvement** - CI/CD, code review practices, documentation culture
- **Project Recovery** - Getting troubled projects back on track

---

## How I Work

### Engagement Models

**Advisory** - Ongoing strategic guidance. Architecture reviews, design consultations, decision support. Flexible hours as needed.

**Project-Based** - Defined deliverables with clear scope. Architecture designs, proof-of-concepts, technical assessments. Fixed timeline and budget.

**Embedded** - Join your team for focused initiatives. Full integration with your workflows, tools, and processes. Weekly or monthly commitment.

### What to Expect

- **Direct communication** - You work with me directly, not a junior consultant
- **Pragmatic solutions** - Technology choices driven by your actual needs, not trends
- **Knowledge transfer** - Your team learns alongside the engagement
- **Clear documentation** - Decisions and designs documented for future reference
