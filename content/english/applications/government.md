## Serve Every Citizen. Process Every Submission.

Government serves everyone—including those without internet, those who prefer paper, and those who need accessible formats. Your systems need to work for all of them.

Single-source publishing. Paper and digital unified. Accessible by default.

---

## The Challenge

Public sector organizations face unique constraints:

**Multiple channels required.** Not everyone has internet. Not everyone can use a screen. Paper forms aren't going away.

**Accessibility is mandatory.** WCAG compliance. Screen reader compatibility. Multiple languages. Not optional.

**Archival requirements.** Records retention measured in decades. Formats must remain readable.

**Legacy system integration.** Existing databases. Established workflows. Can't rip and replace.

**Budget constraints.** Every dollar scrutinized. ROI must be clear.

## How Publish Helps

### Unified Paper + Digital

Write once. Generate web forms for online submission and PDF forms for paper. Both capture to the same database.

- Citizens choose their channel
- Staff process all submissions the same way
- No duplicate data entry
- No channel gets left behind

---

### Accessible by Default

Publish generates accessible outputs automatically:

- **Web forms** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **PDF documents** — Tagged for screen readers
- **Multiple formats** — Same source, different outputs
- **Language variants** — Maintain translations from single source

Accessibility isn't an afterthought. It's built in.

---

### OCR for Paper Returns

Citizens mail paper forms. Publish processes them:

- Scanned forms recognized automatically
- Field positions known precisely (we generated the form)
- Data extracted and validated
- Flows to your database like digital submissions

**No manual data entry. No transcription errors.**

---

### Archival-Ready

Government records last generations:

- **PDF/A output** — ISO-standard archival format
- **Open formats** — No proprietary dependencies
- **Version history** — Complete audit trail
- **Source preservation** — Markdown files version-controlled forever

Your records will be readable in 50 years.

---

### Integrate, Don't Replace

Connect to your existing systems:

- Your database (SQL, whatever you have)
- Your identity provider
- Your document management system
- Your workflow tools

**We're a layer, not a replacement.**

## AI-Powered Processing

Serve every citizen efficiently:

| Capability | Government Application |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Eligibility Screening** | Auto-validate against program rules |
| **Form Validation** | Catch errors before submission |
| **Translation** | Every language your citizens speak |
| **Document OCR** | Process paper submissions, legacy records |
| **Accessibility** | Screen reader compatible, plain language |

AI runs offline. Works in field offices. Works during outages.

---

## Field Operations

Inspectors, census workers, social services in the field:

- **Offline capable** — Rural areas, buildings without signal
- **Voice notes** — Document findings hands-free
- **Photo capture** — Evidence attached to case files
- **Real-time lookup** — Access records in the field

## Data Sovereignty

Your data stays yours:

| Traditional Approach | With WellKnown |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Data in vendor portals | Data on your infrastructure |
| Vendor owns citizen relationship | You own citizen relationship |
| Switching vendors = rebuilding | Switching = reconnect gateway |
| Compliance depends on vendor | You control compliance |

Publish TO external platforms when needed. Never locked IN.

## Complete the Loop with Spatial

Some government work is inherently spatial:

- **Permit visualization** — Building permits on the map
- **Infrastructure management** — Utilities, roads, facilities as digital twins
- **Planning and zoning** — 3D models of proposed developments
- **Asset tracking** — Fleet, equipment, property in space

When your needs extend to 3D, Spatial is ready.
