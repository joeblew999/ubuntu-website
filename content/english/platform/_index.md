## Two Platforms. One Vision.

Design infrastructure for organizations that work in both dimensions—documents and 3D models, forms and factories, PDFs and physical systems.

Built on open standards. Real-time collaboration. Your infrastructure.

---

## Publish: Content Management Platform

**Single-source content management for multi-channel publishing.**

Write once in Markdown. Generate web pages, PDFs, and forms—all perfectly aligned. Capture data from digital or paper submissions back to your database.

### For Organizations That Need:

- **Unified publishing** — One source drives web, PDF, and forms
- **Paper + digital** — Both channels, same data destination
- **OCR capture** — Scanned paper forms to database automatically
- **No lock-in** — Markdown source, standard outputs, your database

### Industries:

Government. Healthcare. Financial services. Education. Insurance. Enterprise operations.

## Spatial: 3D AI Platform

**AI-native infrastructure for three-dimensional design.**

AI that truly understands geometry, not just describes screenshots. Real-time collaboration across global teams. Open standards that outlast any vendor.

### For Organizations That Need:

- **AI + 3D** — Native integration, not bolted-on vision models
- **Global collaboration** — Same model, same moment, no conflicts
- **Open standards** — STEP and IFC. Your geometry belongs to you.
- **Digital twins** — Design connected to sensors and reality

### Industries:

Robotics. Manufacturing. Construction. Simulation. Facility management.

## Common Foundation

Both platforms share core infrastructure:

| Capability | Technology |
|------------|------------|
| **Offline-first** | Work without internet, sync when connected |
| **Real-time collaboration** | Automerge CRDT — simultaneous editing, automatic conflict resolution |
| **Universal deployment** | Web, desktop, and mobile from one codebase |
| **Cloud options** | Our cloud, your cloud, or fully on-premises |
| **Self-sovereign** | Your data, your servers, your rules |
| **Open standards** | No proprietary formats. Export everything. Own your work. |

## Sensing: Perception Layer

**Multi-sensor integration for spatial intelligence.**

Connect LiDAR, cameras, and industrial sensors to your spatial models. Hardware-agnostic edge agent with 5G/eSIM connectivity for any deployment—aerial, ground, robotic, or fixed.

### For Organizations That Need:

- **Sensor fusion** — Multiple streams into coherent spatial data
- **Edge deployment** — Lightweight agent runs anywhere
- **5G/eSIM OTA** — Remote connectivity without SIM swapping
- **Industrial protocols** — Modbus, CAN bus integration

### Industries:

Surveying. Construction. Robotics. Security. Smart infrastructure.

## Choose Your Path

**Need content management?**
Start with [Publish](/platform/publish/). Add Spatial later if you move into 3D.

**Need 3D design and AI?**
Start with [Spatial](/platform/spatial/). Publish integrates when you need documentation.

**Need both?**
They work together. Technical drawings generated from 3D models. BOMs flowing to forms. Documentation aligned with design.
