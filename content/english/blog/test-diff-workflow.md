This is a test post for the diff workflow.

## Initial Content

This section exists from the start.

## NEW SECTION ADDED

This section was added AFTER the initial translation to test the UPDATE workflow.

When you run `task translate:diff FILE=blog/test-diff-workflow.md`, it should show:
- The new section that was added
- Any lines that were modified

This helps translators know exactly what changed.

## Conclusion

Testing complete with more content now.
