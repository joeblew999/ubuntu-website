## Less Administration. Fewer Errors. Better Care.

Healthcare runs on forms. Patient intake. Consent. Medical history. Insurance. Every interaction generates paperwork—and every error in that paperwork affects care.

Single-source publishing. Paper and digital unified. EMR integration built in.

---

## The Challenge

Healthcare documentation is uniquely demanding:

**Paper persists.** Waiting rooms. Bedside. Field clinics. Not everywhere has reliable connectivity or devices.

**Errors cost lives.** Transcription mistakes in medication lists. Misread allergies. Wrong patient identifiers.

**Compliance is complex.** HIPAA. State regulations. Accreditation requirements. Audit trails mandatory.

**Systems don't talk.** EMR from one vendor. Billing from another. Patient portal separate. Integration is painful.

**Time is care.** Every minute on paperwork is a minute not with patients.

---

## How Publish Helps

### Waiting Room + Portal, Same Form

Patients filling out paper in the waiting room and patients completing forms on the portal—same source, same data destination.

- Intake forms work both ways
- No "please fill this out again"
- Consistent data capture
- Faster check-in

---

### Zero Transcription Errors

Paper forms don't require re-keying:

- Patient hands in paper intake
- Staff scans it
- OCR extracts data precisely
- Flows to your systems automatically

**The medication list the patient wrote is the medication list in the system.**

---

### Consent Management

Informed consent. Research consent. HIPAA acknowledgment.

- Generate consent forms from templates
- Capture signatures (digital or scanned)
- Track what was signed, when, by whom
- Version control for evolving requirements

---

### EMR Integration

Connect to your electronic medical record:

- Read patient data to pre-populate forms
- Write captured data back to the chart
- Support your existing workflow
- No rip-and-replace required

Works with Epic, Cerner, and any system with an API.

---

### Compliance Built In

Healthcare has rules. Publish helps you follow them:

- **Audit trails** — Every form, every submission, every access logged
- **Retention** — Documents archived per your policies
- **Access control** — Role-based, integrated with your identity provider
- **Encryption** — Data protected in transit and at rest

---

## Use Cases

### Patient Intake

Registration. Demographics. Insurance. Medical history.

- Same forms for kiosk, paper, and portal
- Pre-populated from existing records
- Validated at capture
- Updates flow to EMR

---

### Clinical Documentation

Assessments. Flowsheets. Progress notes.

- Structured capture for specific protocols
- Bedside paper capture when needed
- Data available for analytics
- Templates for consistency

---

### Consent Forms

Surgical consent. Research enrollment. Treatment authorization.

- Legally sound documentation
- Multiple signature capture methods
- Version tracking
- Retrieval for audits

---

### Referral Management

Referral requests. Prior authorizations. Specialist communication.

- Structured data for routing
- Attachments handled
- Status tracking
- Integration with scheduling

---

### Patient Communication

Discharge instructions. Care plans. Educational materials.

- Generated from patient data
- Multiple formats (print, email, portal)
- Language variants from single source
- Consistent, accurate information

---

## What You Get

### For Patients

- Fill out forms once, not repeatedly

## The Numbers

**Before Publish:**
- 12 minutes average for paper intake processing
- 2% error rate in transcribed data
- Multiple form versions in circulation
- Compliance gaps in paper handling

**After Publish:**
- Paper processed in seconds
- Near-zero transcription errors
- Single source for all forms
- Audit trail for everything

## Complete the Loop with Spatial

Some healthcare work is inherently spatial:

- **Facility management** — Hospital buildings as digital twins
- **Equipment tracking** — Medical devices located in 3D space
- **Surgical planning** — Procedure visualization from imaging
- **Space utilization** — Patient flow, capacity planning

When your needs extend to 3D, Spatial is ready.
