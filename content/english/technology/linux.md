## Linux Expertise. Cross-Platform Delivery.

Ubuntu Software has been building systems on Linux for decades—long before Ubuntu Linux existed. We deploy everywhere: Linux servers, embedded systems, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android.

## The Ubuntu Name

The name Ubuntu comes from the South African philosophy meaning "I am because we are." We chose it years before Canonical adopted the same word for their Linux distribution in 2004.

A happy coincidence: we've spent those same decades building software that runs on Linux and open-source platforms. The philosophy fits perfectly—software that connects people, systems, and ideas.

**Looking for Ubuntu Linux?** You're in the right place for Linux expertise, just not the distro. We build software that runs on Ubuntu Linux, Debian, RHEL, and every other major distribution.

## Linux Heritage

### Server & Desktop Linux

Decades of production systems running on Linux:

- **Enterprise servers** — High-availability systems for global organizations
- **Desktop applications** — Native Linux GUIs, not just web wrappers
- **Development infrastructure** — CI/CD, containerization, orchestration

### Embedded Linux

Real-time systems for industrial and IoT applications:

- **Robotics** — Viam RDK on embedded Linux for autonomous systems
- **Industrial control** — Factory automation, sensor networks
- **Edge computing** — Processing at the device level, not just the cloud

### OpenBSD

When security is non-negotiable:

- **Government systems** — Classification-ready deployments
- **Financial infrastructure** — Systems where breaches aren't acceptable
- **Air-gapped environments** — Networks that can't touch the internet

## Cross-Platform GUI

We build applications that run natively on every platform:

| Platform | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Windows** | Native Windows applications |
| **macOS** | Native Mac applications |
| **Linux** | Native Linux desktop |
| **iOS** | Native mobile apps |
| **Android** | Native mobile apps |

After years of working with Qt, Flutter, and Electron, we developed our own cross-platform GUI framework. Single codebase. Native performance. No compromises.

## Scalable Architecture

### No Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

Every component is redundant. No single server, service, or data center can take down the system.

### No Single Point of Performance (SPOP)

Computation scales horizontally. Add capacity by adding nodes, not by buying bigger servers.

### Hundreds of Data Centers

Architecture designed for global distribution:

- Deploy close to users for low latency
- Replicate for redundancy
- Operate independently when networks partition

### Deployment Flexibility

Run anywhere:

| Option | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Binaries** | Single-file deployment, minimal dependencies |
| **Docker** | Containerized, reproducible environments |
| **Kubernetes** | Orchestrated, auto-scaling clusters |
| **On-premises** | Your hardware, your control |
| **Air-gapped** | Networks that can't reach the internet |

---

## Open Source Foundation

We build on and contribute to open source:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Language** | Go |
| **Messaging** | NATS JetStream |
| **Collaboration** | Automerge (CRDT) |
| **Containers** | Docker, Kubernetes |
| **Platforms** | Linux, OpenBSD |

---

## Why This Matters

Most "cross-platform" solutions are compromises. Web apps wrapped in Electron. Mobile apps that don't feel native. Desktop apps that only really work on one OS.

We build software that:

- **Runs everywhere** — Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, embedded
- **Feels native** — Not a web page pretending to be an app
- **Scales infinitely** — No single point of failure or performance
- **Deploys anywhere** — Cloud, on-prem, air-gapped, edge

Decades of experience. Proven at global scale. Ready for whatever you're building.
