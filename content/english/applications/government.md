## Serve Every Citizen. Process Every Submission.

Government serves everyone—including those without internet, those who prefer paper, and those who need accessible formats. Your systems need to work for all of them.

Single-source publishing. Paper and digital unified. Accessible by default.

---

## The Challenge

Public sector organizations face unique constraints:

**Multiple channels required.** Not everyone has internet. Not everyone can use a screen. Paper forms aren't going away.

**Accessibility is mandatory.** WCAG compliance. Screen reader compatibility. Multiple languages. Not optional.

**Archival requirements.** Records retention measured in decades. Formats must remain readable.

**Legacy system integration.** Existing databases. Established workflows. Can't rip and replace.

**Budget constraints.** Every dollar scrutinized. ROI must be clear.

## How Publish Helps

### Unified Paper + Digital

Write once. Generate web forms for online submission and PDF forms for paper. Both capture to the same database.

- Citizens choose their channel
- Staff process all submissions the same way
- No duplicate data entry
- No channel gets left behind

---

### Accessible by Default

Publish generates accessible outputs automatically:

- **Web forms** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **PDF documents** — Tagged for screen readers
- **Multiple formats** — Same source, different outputs
- **Language variants** — Maintain translations from single source

Accessibility isn't an afterthought. It's built in.

---

### OCR for Paper Returns

Citizens mail paper forms. Publish processes them:

- Scanned forms recognized automatically
- Field positions known precisely (we generated the form)
- Data extracted and validated
- Flows to your database like digital submissions

**No manual data entry. No transcription errors.**

---

### Archival-Ready

Government records last generations:

- **PDF/A output** — ISO-standard archival format
- **Open formats** — No proprietary dependencies
- **Version history** — Complete audit trail
- **Source preservation** — Markdown files version-controlled forever

Your records will be readable in 50 years.

---

### Integrate, Don't Replace

Connect to your existing systems:

- Your database (SQL, whatever you have)
- Your identity provider
- Your document management system
- Your workflow tools

**We're a layer, not a replacement.**
