## About the Name "Ubuntu"

"Ubuntu" is a Nguni Bantu term from Southern Africa, often translated as "I am because we are" or "humanity towards others." It represents a philosophy of human interconnectedness.

We chose this name in 1999 because it reflects our belief in technology that serves humanity - building software that empowers people and communities.

## Current Operations

Ubuntu Software now operates from Australia (ABN: 95 595 575 880), continuing our mission of developing software tools that enhance productivity and respect user privacy.

Our focus areas include:
- Local AI and privacy-preserving software
- Developer productivity tools
- Open source contributions
