# Remote Taskfile Include Test
#
# Validates that external consumers can include Taskfiles from this repo.
# Uses the branch name (head_ref for PRs, ref_name for pushes) since Task's
# remote include requires branch/tag names, not commit SHAs.
#
# This simulates the consumer experience:
# 1. Creates a temp Taskfile outside this repo
# 2. Includes our tools module via git URL
# 3. Bootstraps xplat via download (not build from source)
