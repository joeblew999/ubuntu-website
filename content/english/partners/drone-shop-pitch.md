## The Quick Version

**You sell drones. We provide the software that makes them useful.**

When your customer asks "can this do mapping?" or "can I manage a fleet?"—the answer is yes.

---

## What We Do

We build the **fleet management infrastructure** that connects drones to ground stations, processes telemetry, and enables real-time coordination.

| Your Customer Asks | We Provide |
|-------------------|------------|
| "Can it do mapping?" | Sensor data pipelines, geotagged images to processing |
| "Can I manage 5 drones?" | Multi-vehicle coordination and monitoring |
| "Will it work with our software?" | MAVLink, NATS, open standards |
| "What about cloud?" | Managed infrastructure or self-hosted |

---

## How It Works For You

1. **You sell the hardware** — Holybro, custom builds, whatever you stock
2. **We provide credentials** — Customer's drones connect to our infrastructure
3. **Customer pays subscription** — You earn revenue share (10-20%)
4. **We handle support** — Or you do, your choice

**No inventory risk. No software development. Just recurring revenue on every fleet sale.**

## The DJI Opportunity

Your DJI customers are worried. The US ban is coming. They need a migration path.

We help them transition to open source platforms (PX4, ArduPilot) with:
- Compatible hardware recommendations
- Migration planning
- Fleet infrastructure that doesn't depend on DJI servers

**You become the local expert for DJI migration.** We back you up technically.

## Mapping Specifically

Mapping is the most common request. Here's what we offer:

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Raw sensor pipelines** | Camera images flow from drone to your processing backend |
| **Geotagging** | Position, altitude, orientation for every frame |
| **Real-time telemetry** | Monitor flights as they happen |
| **Multi-drone surveys** | Coordinate multiple aircraft on large sites |
| **Data handoff** | Works with Pix4D, DroneDeploy, ODM, any processor |

We're not a mapping solution—we're the fleet infrastructure that connects drones to mapping solutions.

## Revenue Example

Hypothetical scenario with 5 fleet customers:

| Customer | Vehicles | Monthly Subscription | Your 15% Share |
|----------|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Surveyor A | 3 | $90 | $13.50 |
| Inspection Co | 5 | $150 | $22.50 |
| Ag Service | 10 | $200 | $30.00 |
| SAR Team | 4 | $120 | $18.00 |
| Real Estate | 2 | $60 | $9.00 |
| **Total** | 24 | $620 | **$93/month** |

Recurring revenue from customers you already have. Compounds as your fleet customer base grows.
