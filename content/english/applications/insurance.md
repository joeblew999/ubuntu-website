## Every Channel. One System.

Insurance happens everywhere—online, at the kitchen table with an agent, in the field after an accident. Claims come by app, by mail, by fax. Your systems need to handle all of it without breaking.

Single-source publishing. Field and office unified. Claims processing accelerated.

---

## The Challenge

Insurance documentation spans channels and contexts:

**Field agents work offline.** Rural areas. Disaster sites. Customer homes. Connectivity isn't guaranteed.

**Paper persists.** Signed applications. Mailed claims. Faxed documents. It's not going away.

**Speed matters.** Claims delayed are customers frustrated. Applications stuck are sales lost.

**Accuracy is everything.** Wrong policy details. Missed conditions. Incorrect payouts. Errors are expensive.

**Systems are siloed.** Policy admin. Claims. Underwriting. Customer service. Each has its own view.

---

## How Publish Helps

### Field-Ready Forms

Agents work where customers are:

- Forms work offline on tablets
- Paper backup always available
- Sync when connectivity returns
- Same data destination either way

**Sell and service anywhere.**

---

### Claims from Any Channel

Customers report losses their way:

- Mobile app with photo capture
- Online forms with document upload
- Paper claims mailed in
- Phone claims captured by staff

All flow to the same claims queue.

---

### OCR for Paper

Paper claims don't mean manual processing:

- Scanned documents recognized
- Data extracted accurately
- Validation applied automatically
- Straight to adjudication queue

**First notice of loss in minutes, not days.**

---

### Policy System Integration

Connect to your core systems:

- Read policy data to populate forms

- No platform replacement required

---

### Document Generation

Produce what customers and regulators need:

## AI-Powered Processing

Faster claims, better accuracy:

| Capability | Insurance Application |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Claims Triage** | Route to right adjuster by type, severity |
| **Document Analysis** | Extract data from photos, PDFs, handwritten notes |
| **Fraud Indicators** | Pattern detection across applications |
| **Translation** | Serve policyholders in their language |
| **Policy Matching** | Auto-validate claims against coverage |

All processing on your infrastructure. Sensitive customer data stays private.

---

## Field Operations

Adjusters and agents in the field with full system access:

## Data Sovereignty

Your data stays yours:

| Traditional Approach | With WellKnown |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Data in vendor portals | Data on your infrastructure |
| Vendor owns policyholder relationship | You own policyholder relationship |
| Switching vendors = rebuilding | Switching = reconnect gateway |
| Compliance depends on vendor | You control compliance |

Publish TO external platforms when needed. Never locked IN.

## Complete the Loop with Spatial

Some insurance work is inherently spatial:

- **Property inspection** — Buildings documented in 3D
- **Risk assessment** — Facilities evaluated visually
- **Claims investigation** — Accident reconstruction
- **Asset management** — Insured property portfolios

When your needs extend to 3D, Spatial is ready.
