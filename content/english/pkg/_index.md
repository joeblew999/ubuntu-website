- **Flight controllers** — Pixhawk, Cube, CUAV, custom autopilots
- **Companion computers** — Jetson, Raspberry Pi, Intel NUC
- **Sensors** — LiDAR, cameras, RTK GPS, rangefinders
- **Radios** — ExpressLRS, Crossfire, SiK telemetry, cellular modems
- **Ground control** — QGroundControl, Mission Planner, custom GCS

We're happy to collaborate on drivers, protocol bridges, and integration testing.
