## 25 Years Building Real-Time Systems. Now Building the Future.

Ubuntu Software didn't start with a pitch deck. It started with two decades of building systems where failure wasn't an option.

---

## The Foundation

Investment banks. Energy companies. Automotive manufacturers. Retail giants. Engineering firms.

For 25 years, I built the systems these organizations depended on:

**Trading floors** where milliseconds mattered and downtime meant millions lost.

**Manufacturing systems** where production lines couldn't wait for software to catch up.

**Retail platforms** where real-time inventory across thousands of stores wasn't optional.

**Engineering systems** where collaboration across continents had to actually work.

The common thread: **real-time, distributed, mission-critical.**

Not demos. Not prototypes. Systems that ran. Systems that scaled. Systems that couldn't fail.

---

## The Pattern

Across industries, across decades, the same problems kept appearing:

**Collaboration is hard.** Getting distributed teams to work on shared data without conflicts, without version nightmares, without losing information—this is an unsolved problem in most industries.

**Legacy tools hold everyone back.** Software designed for a different era, patched and extended past its limits, unable to integrate with modern approaches.

**The gap between design and reality.** Models that don't match what's built. Drawings that don't reflect what's operated. Information that evaporates at handoffs.

**Intelligence bolted on, not built in.** AI added as an afterthought to architectures that can't support it.

These patterns repeated everywhere. Finance. Manufacturing. Retail. Engineering. Construction.

---

## The Convergence

Then, in a compressed few years, everything changed:

**CRDTs matured.** Automerge and similar technologies finally solved real-time collaboration without conflicts. The computer science caught up with the need.

**AI became capable.** Large language models moved from curiosity to capability. Tool use. Reasoning. Actual assistance with complex tasks.

**WebAssembly delivered.** Desktop-class performance in the browser. True cross-platform without compromise.

**Open standards won.** STEP and IFC gained acceptance across industries. The format wars settled.

**Event-driven architecture scaled.** NATS JetStream and similar systems made real-time, distributed messaging practical at any scale.

Each of these I'd been watching. Working with. Waiting for.

And then I saw where they converged.

## The Realization

AI learned to read, then write.

AI learned to see, then create images.

AI learned to watch, then generate video.

**But AI still couldn't understand space.**

The physical world—buildings, factories, robots, cities—exists in three dimensions. It has physics. Constraints. Interconnections. You can't flatten it into text or images and expect AI to truly help.

For AI to design the physical world, it needs to think in 3D.

Everything I'd built—real-time systems, distributed collaboration, enterprise-grade reliability—was preparation for this.

The platform where AI and three-dimensional design converge.

---

## Why Ubuntu Software

The name comes from the philosophy: **"I am because we are."**

Software doesn't exist in isolation. It exists in connection—between people, between systems, between design and reality.

The systems I've built have always been about connection:

- Traders connected to markets
- Engineers connected across continents
- Factories connected to design
- Buildings connected to their operators

Now: **AI connected to the physical world.**

## The Team

Ubuntu Software is an Australian company. We're small by design. Focused. Building the core platform before scaling the organization.

We're looking for collaborators—early customers who want to shape the direction, partners who see the same convergence, engineers who want to build something that matters.

## The Approach

**Open standards.** No lock-in. Your data remains yours.

**Built in the open.** Feedback from real users shapes real decisions.

**Enterprise-grade from day one.** We know what production systems require because we've built them for 25 years.

**AI-native, not AI-added.** The platform assumes intelligence, doesn't bolt it on.

---

## What's Next

The foundation is laid. The technologies have converged. The market is ready.

We're building the platform where AI designs reality.

If you're working in robotics, simulation, digital twins, manufacturing, or construction—if you see the same convergence we do—we want to hear from you.

## The Clients Who Shaped Us

The experience that built this foundation came from work with:

- **Nomura** — Investment banking systems
- **ABN AMRO** — Financial trading platforms
- **Audi** — Automotive manufacturing
- **BP** — Energy sector systems
- **Metro AG** — Retail at scale
- **Bilfinger** — Engineering and facility management
- **BMG** — Media and entertainment
- **European Union** — Government-scale systems

25 years. Global enterprises. Mission-critical systems.

Now applied to the next frontier.
