## Two Platforms. Ten Industries.

Whether you're designing robot work cells or processing insurance claims, we have infrastructure for you.

**Spatial** — AI-native 3D design for industries that work in physical space.

**Publish** — Single-source document publishing for industries that run on forms.

Both platforms share our core foundation: AI assistance, offline-first architecture, Automerge sync, and open standards.

## Spatial Applications

**For industries working in three dimensions.**

### [Robotics & Automation](/applications/robotics)
Spatial reasoning for the machines that will shape our world. Work cell design, path planning, and multi-robot coordination.

### [Simulation & Training](/applications/simulation)
Where AI learns in virtual space before acting in the real world. Synthetic environments, training data at scale, sim-to-real pipelines.

### [Digital Twins](/applications/digital-twins)
Bridge design and reality. Living models connected to sensors, predictive maintenance, facility management with spatial intelligence.

### [Manufacturing](/applications/manufacturing)
From design to fabrication with AI that understands production constraints. CAM, process planning, quality integration.

### [Construction](/applications/construction)
Modular, prefabricated, intelligent building design. Global teams, real-time collaboration, factory integration.

---

## Publish Applications

**For industries running on documents and forms.**

### [Government & Public Sector](/applications/government)
Serve every citizen. Paper and digital unified. Accessible formats, archival compliance, legacy system integration.

### [Healthcare](/applications/healthcare)
Less administration, fewer errors, better care. Patient intake, consent management, EMR integration.

### [Financial Services](/applications/financial)
Compliance without complexity. Loan applications, disclosures, regulatory documentation with complete audit trails.

### [Education](/applications/education)
Modern administration, traditional options. Enrollment, permissions, student records—paper and portal unified.

### [Insurance](/applications/insurance)
Every channel, one system. Field agents, online customers, mailed claims—all processed uniformly.

## Shared Foundation

Both platforms are built on the same core technology:

| Capability | How It Helps |
|------------|--------------|
| **AI Assistance** | Natural language interaction with your documents or designs |
| **Offline-First** | Work without connectivity, sync automatically when reconnected |
| **Automerge Sync** | Real-time collaboration without conflicts |
| **Open Standards** | No lock-in, export everything, own your work |

---

## Find Your Fit

**Working in 3D?** Start with [Spatial](/platform/spatial/).

**Working with documents?** Start with [Publish](/platform/publish/).

**Need both?** They integrate seamlessly. Technical drawings from 3D models. BOMs flowing to forms. Documentation aligned with design.
