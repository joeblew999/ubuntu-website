# CLAUDE

We have basic claude integration. I think its in the google MCP thing.

But we need to make it more of a first class thing, because just like we sit here in VSCODE with CLAUDE, users with our software on theroi Desktops will essentialyl be doing the same thng at runtime !

Some will have CLAUDE installed and other will not. 

The current install thing using bun / npm 

bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle)                                                                                                         Context left until auto-compact: 5%  
                                                                                                             ✗ Auto-update failed · Try claude doctor or npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

Also we need to be able to control where claude config is and configured. 

We have our laptop setup so Calaude does not ask for permissions, and we will need that for our users too on the folder that is like their own Hugo project.

Also the Google MCP rights

We have not done the Verification with Google yet.

ALSO we need to Update Our Web site to say how the Google Drive, Sheets, etc are used for Parsing and Outputs.

Its part of the WellKnown system, and allows Operators and Users to easily push data both to the Web, but also to their own Google Systems.
