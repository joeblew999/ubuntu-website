## AI Thinks in 2D. We Give It Spatial Intelligence.

Today's AI is remarkably capable—it can read, write, see images, and hold conversations. But it thinks in flat dimensions: text is 1D, images are 2D, video is 2D over time.

**The real world is 3D.**

For AI to truly interact with physical reality—to design buildings, guide robots, manage facilities, or plan manufacturing—it needs spatial intelligence. The ability to understand geometry, reason about physical constraints, and work with three-dimensional space.

That's what we're building: a platform that bridges AI's cognitive abilities with 3D spatial understanding, enabling machines to work with the physical world.

{{< tab "Construction" >}}

### Modular & Prefabricated Construction

The construction industry is shifting toward factory-built modular housing. Prefabrication offers faster builds, better quality control, and reduced waste—but traditional CAD tools weren't designed for this workflow.

**The Challenge:**
- Distributed teams across factory floors, engineering offices, and construction sites
- Need for real-time collaboration, not file-based save-merge-commit cycles
- Proprietary formats creating vendor lock-in
- Legacy systems that can't integrate AI assistance

**Our Approach:**
- **Real-Time Collaboration** — Teams in Thailand, Germany, and Australia work on the same model simultaneously using Automerge CRDT technology
- **100% Open Standards** — STEP and IFC formats ensure your designs remain yours, accessible regardless of software changes
- **AI-Assisted Design** — Natural language commands, design optimization suggestions, and automatic error detection
- **Module-Centric Workflow** — First-class support for prefab components, assembly sequencing, and transport planning

### Digital Twins & Facility Management

Bridge the gap between design and the real world. Our approach is informed by experience with AI-powered facility management systems, including work with [Bilfinger](https://www.bilfinger.com/), one of Germany's leading engineering and services companies.

**Capabilities:**
- **Live Sensor Integration** — Connect your 3D models to real-time IoT data from buildings and infrastructure
- **Predictive Maintenance** — AI-driven analysis to identify equipment issues before they become failures
- **What-If Simulation** — Test scenarios in your digital twin before implementing changes in reality
- **Facility Management** — Manage building systems, track assets, and optimize operations through a spatial interface

**Architecture:**
Built on NATS JetStream for event-driven, real-time data flow between physical sensors and digital models. The same spatial intelligence that helps design a building can monitor and manage it throughout its lifecycle.

### Manufacturing & Automation

When AI understands 3D space, it can participate in physical production—from design through fabrication to quality control.

**Applications:**
- **Robotics Integration** — Provide spatial context for automated systems, enabling smarter path planning and assembly operations
- **Production Planning** — AI assistance for layout optimization, process sequencing, and resource allocation
- **Quality Control** — Compare as-built geometry against design intent, automatically detecting deviations
- **Assembly Documentation** — Generate work instructions that understand three-dimensional relationships

**Beyond Construction:**
While our initial focus is on modular construction, the platform's spatial intelligence applies to any manufacturing domain—automotive, aerospace, consumer products, industrial equipment. Anywhere AI needs to reason about physical geometry.
