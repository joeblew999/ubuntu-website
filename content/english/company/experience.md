## 25 Years. Global Enterprises. Systems That Couldn't Fail.

Before Ubuntu Software built the platform where AI designs reality, we spent decades building real-time, mission-critical systems for organizations where downtime wasn't an option.

This is the foundation everything else is built on.

## Industries

### Investment Banking & Finance

**Nomura** — One of Japan's largest investment banks. Trading systems where milliseconds mattered and reliability was non-negotiable.

**ABN AMRO** — Global banking infrastructure. Systems processing billions in transactions, operating across time zones, integrated with markets worldwide.

Real-time data. Zero tolerance for failure. Global scale.

---

### Automotive

**Audi** — Manufacturing systems for one of Germany's premier automotive brands. Production line integration. Supply chain connectivity. Quality systems that tracked every component.

Precision engineering meets software engineering.

---

### Energy

**BP** — Systems for one of the world's largest energy companies. Operational technology. Data integration across global assets. Real-time monitoring at scale.

When the systems matter as much as the infrastructure they monitor.

---

### Retail

**Metro AG** — One of Europe's largest retail and wholesale companies. Inventory systems spanning thousands of locations. Real-time stock management. Supply chain visibility.

Scale measured in stores, warehouses, and transactions per second.

---

### Engineering & Facility Management

**Bilfinger** — One of Germany's leading engineering and services companies. AI-powered facility management systems. Digital twin implementation. IoT integration at enterprise scale.

Where our current work in digital twins began.

---

### Media & Entertainment

**BMG** — Global music company. Rights management systems. Royalty processing. Catalog integration across acquisitions.

Complex data, complex rules, global operations.

---

### Government

**European Union** — Systems at continental scale. Multi-language. Multi-jurisdiction. Compliance-critical.

When the stakeholder is 450 million people.

---

## What We Built

Across these clients, common patterns emerged in what we delivered:

### Real-Time Systems

Not batch processing. Not eventual consistency. Systems where data flowed in real-time:

- Trading platforms processing market data in milliseconds
- Manufacturing systems tracking production as it happened
- Retail inventory updating across thousands of locations
- Facility management responding to sensor data continuously

**Real-time isn't a feature. It's an architecture.**

---

### Distributed Collaboration

Before "collaboration software" was a category:

- Engineering teams across continents working on shared systems
- Trading desks in multiple time zones with consistent data
- Manufacturing facilities coordinated in real-time
- Supply chains visible end-to-end

**Distributed teams need distributed systems.**

---

### Mission-Critical Reliability

Systems that couldn't go down:

- Trading platforms where downtime meant regulatory consequences
- Manufacturing lines where stoppage meant millions in losses
- Retail systems where Black Friday doesn't wait
- Energy systems where monitoring isn't optional

**Reliability isn't achieved. It's engineered.**

---

### Integration at Scale

Nothing exists in isolation:

- Connecting legacy systems to modern architectures
- Integrating acquisitions without disruption
- Bridging proprietary systems with open standards
- Building APIs before "API-first" was a term

**Integration is where most projects fail. We made it work.**

---

### Enterprise-Grade Security

Global enterprises don't take chances:

- Financial systems meeting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions
- Manufacturing systems protecting intellectual property
- Energy systems securing critical infrastructure
- Government systems meeting continental compliance standards

**Security built in, not bolted on.**

---

## Technical Depth

The systems we've built required mastery across:

**Backend Systems**
- High-performance server architectures
- Message-oriented middleware
- Database systems at scale
- Event-driven architectures

**Real-Time Data**
- Stream processing
- Complex event processing
- Time-series data management
- Low-latency messaging

**Integration**
- Enterprise service buses
- API design and management
- Legacy system integration
- Protocol translation

**Infrastructure**
- Distributed systems design
- High availability architectures
- Disaster recovery
- Global deployment

---

## Why This Matters Now

Every lesson from 25 years of enterprise systems applies to what we're building:

| Enterprise Experience | Platform Application |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Real-time trading data | Real-time design collaboration |
| Distributed manufacturing | Distributed design teams |
| Facility management IoT | Digital twin architecture |
| Financial system reliability | Engineering-grade platform |
| Global enterprise scale | Global design teams |

**We're not learning how to build production systems. We've been doing it for decades.**

---

## The Difference

Many startups pitch vision without foundation.

We have:

- **Proven track record** — Systems running in production at global scale
- **Enterprise relationships** — We know how large organizations actually work
- **Technical depth** — Architectural decisions made from experience, not theory
- **Reliability mindset** — Building for production from day one

**25 years of building what works. Now applied to what's next.**
