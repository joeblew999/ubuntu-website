We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:

- **Authorized** — We will not pursue legal action against you
- **Helpful** — We value your contribution to improving our security
- **Protected** — We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue

If you make a good-faith effort to comply with this policy during your research, we will not initiate or recommend legal action against you.
