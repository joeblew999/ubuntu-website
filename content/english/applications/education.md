## Modern Administration. Traditional Options.

Schools serve families with different preferences and access levels. Some parents are digital-first. Others need paper. Administrative systems must work for both—without doubling the workload.

Single-source publishing. Paper and digital unified. Student information system integration.

---

## The Challenge

Education administration has unique pressures:

**Families vary.** Some complete everything online instantly. Others need paper sent home, returned, and processed.

**Volume spikes.** Enrollment season. Back to school. End of year. Sudden floods of forms.

**Staff constraints.** Registrars, secretaries, and office staff stretched thin.

**System fragmentation.** SIS from one vendor. Finance from another. State reporting separate.

**Compliance requirements.** FERPA. State mandates. Special education documentation.

## How Publish Helps
