# MAPPING

I was asked by a Drone shop about mapping.

We really need a good mapping solution for Drone.

https://github.com/bdon has soem good stuff for maps

https://github.com/akhenakh/gedtm30api lookks amazing for us

- 310GB for the whole world. SO where to put it ?

- https://zenodo.org/records/15689805 for more info on how and why ?

Due to Zenodo's storage limitations, the original GEDTM30 dataset and its standard deviation map are provided via external links:

I wonder if this data can also be usd to help fly with no GPS too ?
