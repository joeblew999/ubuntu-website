# The Platform

## AI-Native 3D Design Infrastructure

This isn't CAD with AI bolted on. It's a platform built from the ground up for a world where artificial intelligence and three-dimensional design converge.

---

## Core Architecture

### 3D-Native AI Integration

AI that truly understands space, not just describes screenshots.

Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP), our platform gives AI systems direct access to geometry, spatial relationships, constraints, and physics. AI doesn't look at your design—it works inside it.

- Spatial reasoning, not image recognition
- Constraint-aware generation
- Physics-informed optimization
- Conversational design interaction

---

### Open Standards, Forever

Your geometry. Your data. No lock-in. Ever.

**STEP (ISO 10303)** — Industry-standard 3D geometry exchange. The format aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing trust.

**IFC (ISO 16739)** — Native Building Information Modeling. Full semantic richness for the built environment.

No proprietary formats. No conversion loss. No vendor dependency. Your work outlasts any software.

---

### Real-Time Collaboration

Distributed teams working as one.

**Automerge CRDT** at the core. Not save-and-merge. Not lock-and-wait. True simultaneous editing with automatic conflict resolution.

- Factory floor and engineering office on the same model
- Same moment. No conflicts.
- Global teams. Local performance.

**Offline-first.** Work without connectivity. Sync automatically when reconnected. Full version history with branching and merging.

---

### Digital Twin Architecture

Design connected to reality.

**NATS JetStream** event-driven messaging bridges the gap between design and the physical world.

- Live sensor data flowing into your model
- Simulation running against real-world inputs
- IoT device management from the design environment
- Predictive maintenance before failures happen

---

### Run Anywhere

Your infrastructure. Your rules.

**Web** — Modern browser, full functionality
**Desktop** — Native experience via embedded webview
**Mobile** — Tablets and phones, no compromise

**Online** — Cloud collaboration and access from anywhere
**Offline** — Air-gapped environments, complete control
**Hybrid** — Sensitive work local, collaboration in the cloud
**Self-Hosted** — Your servers, your data, your security model

## Technical Foundation

Built with technologies chosen for longevity and openness:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Geometry | STEP/IFC native formats |
| Collaboration | Automerge CRDT |
| Messaging | NATS JetStream |
| AI Integration | Model Context Protocol |
| Frontend | Web-native with webview embedding |
| Architecture | Event-driven, extensible plugin system |

---

## Why Now?

Five technologies matured at once:

**CRDTs are production-ready** — Automerge solved real-time collaboration without conflicts

**AI can use tools** — LLMs with function calling can manipulate complex systems

**Open standards won** — STEP and IFC are accepted across industries

**WebAssembly delivers** — Desktop-class performance in the browser

**The market is ready** — Every industry asking how AI applies to physical design

The window is open. We're building through it.
