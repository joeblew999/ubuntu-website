## Spatial Intelligence for the Machines That Will Shape Our World

Every robot needs to understand space. Navigate it. Manipulate objects within it. Collaborate with humans inside it.

But today's robotics toolchains weren't built for AI. They weren't built for real-time collaboration. They weren't built for the explosion that's coming.

## The Moment

**Robotics is entering its exponential phase.**

- **Humanoids are real.** Tesla Optimus. Figure. 1X. Sanctuary. Agility. Chinese manufacturers racing to market. Billions in investment. Millions of units planned.
- **Warehouse automation is scaling.** Every logistics company, every e-commerce player, every manufacturer automating at speed.
- **Surgical robots are proliferating.** Precision medicine demands precision machines.
- **Autonomous vehicles need environments.** Not just roads—loading docks, warehouses, construction sites, farms.

They all share one requirement: **AI that understands and designs in three dimensions.**

---

## The Problem

**Today's tools are fragmented:**

- **CAD lives in one world.** Mechanical design, static files, manual handoff.
- **Simulation lives in another.** Separate environments, separate formats, separate teams.
- **AI lives in a third.** Bolted on. Looking at screenshots. No native understanding.
- **Collaboration?** Email attachments. File versioning nightmares. "Which model is current?"

The robotics industry is building the future with tools from the past.

## What We Enable

### AI-Native Spatial Reasoning

**Robots don't just need geometry—they need AI that understands it.**

Model Context Protocol integration gives AI systems direct access to:

- **Workspace geometry** — Not images of workspaces. The actual 3D structure.
- **Collision boundaries** — What can the arm reach? What must it avoid?
- **Kinematic chains** — Joint limits, degrees of freedom, reachability analysis
- **Semantic understanding** — This is a gripper. That's a conveyor. Here's the human zone.

AI that can reason: *"If we move this fixture 200mm left, the robot gains access to the rear panel without reorientation."*

---

### Work Cell Design

**The robot is only part of the system.**

Design complete work cells with AI assistance:

- **Layout optimization** — Position robots, fixtures, conveyors for maximum efficiency
- **Reach analysis** — Verify every target is accessible before build
- **Cycle time simulation** — Optimize paths and sequences
- **Safety zone planning** — Human collaboration zones, light curtains, interlocks
- **Changeover design** — Flexible cells that adapt to product variants

---

### Path Planning & Simulation

**From design to motion.**

- **Collision-free path generation** — AI-assisted trajectory planning
- **Multi-robot coordination** — Synchronized motion, no conflicts
- **Digital twin validation** — Test in simulation before physical deployment
- **What-if scenarios** — Change the layout, see the impact instantly

---

### Real-Time Collaboration

**Robotics is a team sport.**

Mechanical engineers. Controls engineers. Integration specialists. End customers. Often distributed globally.

Automerge CRDT synchronization:

- Everyone working on the same model simultaneously
- No file locking. No merge conflicts. No "who has the latest version?"
- Changes visible in real-time across the team
- Full version history for every decision

---

### Open Standards

**No vendor lock-in. Full interoperability.**

STEP geometry works with every major CAD and simulation system. Export to your robot OEM's tools. Import from your customer's designs. No translation loss.

Your work cell design isn't trapped in a proprietary format. It's yours.

---

### Simulation to Reality

**Close the gap.**

NATS JetStream architecture connects your digital twin to the physical cell:

- Stream real sensor data into simulation
- Validate models against actual performance
- Predict maintenance before failures
- Continuous improvement loop from production back to design

---

## Use Cases

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Humanoid Deployment** | Design the environments humanoids will work in. AI-assisted layout for human-robot collaboration. Simulation before deployment. |
| **Warehouse Automation** | Mobile robots, goods-to-person systems, automated storage. Design, simulate, and optimize at scale. |
| **Manufacturing Cells** | Welding, assembly, machine tending, palletizing. Complete work cell design with AI assistance. |
| **Surgical Robotics** | Precision environments for precision machines. Spatial constraints, sterile zones, equipment integration. |
| **Field Robotics** | Agricultural, construction, mining. Design for unstructured environments. |

## Complete the Loop with Publish

Robotics isn't just 3D models—it's documentation, too.

- **Work instructions** — Assembly guides generated from the model
- **Safety documentation** — Procedures, checklists, compliance forms
- **Maintenance manuals** — Equipment specs, part numbers, service intervals
- **Training materials** — Operator guides with visuals from the simulation

All from single source. All aligned with your 3D work cell design.
