**Last Updated:** December 2024

**Ubuntu Software** (ABN: 95 595 575 880) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information when you visit our website and use our software tools.

## Information We Collect

### Website

Our website at www.ubuntusoftware.net is static. We do not:

- Collect personal information through the website
- Use tracking cookies
- Require user accounts or logins
- Store any user data on our servers

### Software Tools

Our command-line tools (CLI) operate entirely on your local device. When you use our tools to connect to third-party services like Google Workspace, all data processing occurs locally on your machine.

## Google API Services Usage

Our software tools integrate with Google APIs to provide productivity features. This section describes how we handle Google user data in compliance with the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy).

### Data We Access

When you authorize our tools to connect to your Google account, we may access:

- **Gmail:** Email sending capabilities (compose and send emails)
- **Google Calendar:** View and create calendar events
- **Google Drive:** List, upload, download, and manage files
- **Google Sheets:** Read and write spreadsheet data
- **Google Docs:** Read and write document content
- **Google Slides:** Read and create presentations

### How We Use Your Data

Your Google data is used **exclusively** to:

- Execute the commands you explicitly request through our CLI tools
- Display information you request (calendar events, files, etc.)
- Send emails or create content when you instruct the tool to do so

**We do NOT:**

- Store your Google data on any external servers
- Transmit your data to third parties
- Use your data for advertising or marketing
- Analyze your data for any purpose other than executing your commands
- Retain your data after the command execution completes

### Data Storage and Retention

- **OAuth tokens** are stored locally on your device in your home directory
- **Your Google data** is never stored persistently - it is only held in memory during command execution
- You can revoke access at any time through [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

### Limited Use Disclosure

Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

Specifically:

1. We limit our use of Google user data to providing or improving user-facing features
2. We do not transfer Google user data to others unless necessary to provide features, with user consent, or for legal reasons
3. We do not use Google user data for advertising
4. We do not allow humans to read Google user data unless with user consent, for security purposes, or to comply with law

## Hosting and Third-Party Services

Our website is hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**. Cloudflare may collect standard web server logs (IP addresses, browser type, pages visited) for security and performance purposes. Please refer to [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacy/) for details on their data practices.

## Cookies

We do not use cookies for tracking or advertising. Any cookies present are strictly functional (such as those required by Cloudflare for security).

## Your Rights

### GDPR (European Union)

If you are located in the European Union, you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including:

- **Right to Access** - Request information about any data held about you

- **Right to Object** - Object to processing of your data

- **Revocation:** You can revoke our access at any time via [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- **Transparency:** Our tools display exactly what actions they perform with your data

## Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures:

- OAuth tokens are stored with restricted file permissions (readable only by your user account)
- All communication with Google APIs uses HTTPS encryption
- No data is transmitted to our servers
