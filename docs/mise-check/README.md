# mise-check in this repo

This repo pins [mise-check](https://github.com/joeblew999/mise-check) in `.mise/config.toml`, from its GitHub
releases: `mise install` gets it. Every command is a task of `.mise/tasks/mise-check.toml`: `mise run mise-check:<command>`
runs `mise-check <command>`. Start with `mise run mise-check`: what's done, and what to run next.

## A new repo

At the repository's root (GitHub and Claude Code read `.github/` and `.claude/` only there), with mise installed once
on each machine ([mise's getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html): `curl https://mise.run | sh`, or
`brew install mise`). An empty folder, its own git, then mise-check's files and the template's little app, exactly as
mise-check's own walk proves it on macOS, Linux and Windows:

```sh
git init
mise exec "github:joeblew999/mise-check[minimum_release_age=0s]@latest" -- mise-check init   # mise-check's files, pinned at that release
mise run mise-check:template                                       # the app, its go.mod, mise.toml, package.json
mise install                                                       # node, aube, Go (from go.mod)
mise run setup                                                     # the packages (aube install)
mise run mise-check                                                # what's done, and what to run next
```

`init` writes the repo's `.mise/` folder (its tasks, and mise-check pinned at exactly the release that ran it, which
mise gets from GitHub), its GitHub workflow, its Claude Code hook and skill, this page and its `.gitignore`.

`@latest` is mise-check's newest release as mise lists it; name one instead of `latest` for that one (they're all on
[its releases](https://github.com/joeblew999/mise-check/releases)). mise holds back a release younger than a day
(`minimum_release_age`), which `[minimum_release_age=0s]` lifts for this one command, writing nothing anywhere else.
In the minutes after a release mise may not list it yet: its versions host lists one some time after it's out, and
GitHub's API caches its answer a minute or more, which nothing in a repo can shorten. `init` then says so on its last
line, with the one command for the newest, an exact release, which mise gets at once:
`mise exec github:joeblew999/mise-check@<release> -- mise-check init`.

From then on the repo's own `.mise/config.toml` takes mise-check at its newest release, on every machine and in CI:
never held back a day (its name in `minimum_release_age_excludes`), and from GitHub's own list of releases, not the
versions host (`use_versions_host = false`); `mise-check:check` says when it doesn't. Every tool whose init keeps its
parts of the file with `miseconfig` (below) adds its own name to that list, beside the repo's entries and the other
tools', so no list of tools is kept anywhere.

No Go is needed first: `mise-check:template` writes the go.mod, and `mise install` brings the Go it names. A repo with
code of its own skips `mise-check:template`, which never writes over a file anyway. Commit what `init` and `template`
wrote.

## A new mise tool repo

mise-check is the template for a new mise tool repo, a tool built the way mise-check and mise-cloudflare are: its
binary, its template, its walks, its release and its CI. In an empty folder with its own git:

```sh
gh repo create <owner>/<name> --public    # its GitHub repo, empty: mise gets the tool's releases there
mise exec "github:joeblew999/mise-check[minimum_release_age=0s]@latest" -- mise-check new-tool github.com/<owner>/<name>
mise install
mise run root:ci
```

It runs mise-check's newest release, as `init` does in [A new repo](#a-new-repo). Without its GitHub repo, `new-tool` stops and says to make it.

It copies mise-check at that release, everything git holds, from Go's module proxy, as `go get` has it; renames
`mise-check` to `<name>` in every file's name and contents; and drops mise-check's packages (`misecheck`, `walk`,
`release`, `toolfiles`, `miseconfig`), which the new repo imports from mise-check instead, pinned at that release. Its
README is a short one, saying what to do next. `root:ci` passes from the start. Then you remove what the new tool
doesn't need, and misecheck names what's left of each command you remove.

### The rules a tool repo follows

Every mise tool repo has one shape: mise-check's own, every one `new-tool` makes, mise-cloudflare's, mise-intl's.
The shared machinery is mise-check's packages, imported at the release `.mise/config.toml` pins, never copied.

1. **One CI command.** `root:ci` in its `mise.toml` is exactly what GitHub's CI runs: `root:verify` (the checks and
   the walks), then anything only CI adds. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `mise run root:ci` and nothing else of its
   own, on a push to main and on a pull request: never on a tag, nor on every branch's push.
2. **Its release is `release`.** One test, run by its `tool:release` task, which `release.yml` runs on main:

   ```go
   func TestToolRelease(t *testing.T) { release.Run(t, release.Config{NewRepo: "new-repo:e2e"}) }
   ```

   The commit's `v*` tag or the next patch, tagged and pushed; goreleaser's binaries on its GitHub release; a new repo
   made at it and walked (`new-repo:e2e --version <tag>`); the version on proxy.golang.org. `-dry-run` (the task's
   `--dry-run`) tags and publishes nothing.
3. **Its init is `toolfiles`.** It writes the template's tool half into a repo, and its check reports what of it a
   repo lacks:

   ```go
   t := toolfiles.Tool{Files: templates.Tool, Hook: "<name>-session-start.sh", Config: miseconfig.Tool{
   	Name: "github:<owner>/<name>", Release: "0.1.0", Template: tmpl, Init: "mise run <name>:init"}}
   err := t.Write(dir)          // init: every file; of the repo's own three, only the tool's parts
   problems := t.Problems(dir)  // check: each naming Config.Init
   ```

   The repo's own `.mise/config.toml`, `.gitignore` and `.claude/settings.json` keep everything of theirs. In
   `.mise/config.toml` (`miseconfig`) the tool's parts are its pin (added, or moved forward to the release; `local`
   and `latest` stay), its own name in `minimum_release_age_excludes`, `use_versions_host = false`, and the comment
   at the file's top when the file is the tool's (it starts `# <name> `), each with its comment from the template's
   `.mise/config.toml` (`tmpl`).
4. **No task wraps mise-check's.** A tool's template has no task that runs `mise-check`: its init calls
   `toolfiles.MiseCheckInit(dir)`, which runs mise-check's own init in the repo, at the release of mise-check the tool
   is built with (its go.mod's), so the tool's users run `mise run mise-check:<command>` themselves.
5. **Its README opens with the problem.** Right after its title and badges, a paragraph starting `**The problem.**`
   (what's hard without it), then one starting `**What <name> does.**` (how it solves it). Every repo's does, a tool's
   or an app's: `mise-check:check` reports a README.md without both in the 30 lines after its title.
6. **misecheck holds it to these.** Its test of its root mise file calls `misecheck.CheckToolRepo(t, ".")` beside
   `Check`, which fails on a missing `root:ci` or `root:verify`, a ci.yml that runs anything else or on tags or every
   branch, a README without its two openings, and a template task that runs mise-check, each saying what to change.

## The tasks

| Task | Run it | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `mise run mise-check` | first, and whenever you're unsure | what's done for the repo, and what to run next |
| `mise run mise-check:init` | after upgrading mise-check | writes mise-check's files again: its tasks, the workflow, the skill, the docs, the hook |
| `mise run mise-check:check` | after any change to a mise file or a skill; when it fails, fix the side it names | the repo's rules: its mise files by misecheck, its skills against their tasks, its README's opening, mise-check's files current, its two pins (the binary in mise, the packages in go.mod) at one release |
| `mise run mise-check:show` | to see where the repo is | the same as mise run mise-check |
| `mise run mise-check:verify` | before every push | what GitHub runs: each pin consistent with what pins it, the repo's setup and test, then check |
| `mise run mise-check:update` | when the person asks to upgrade everything | every pin at its newest: the three below, in order, then mise-check's two pins at one release |
| `mise run mise-check:update-mise` | to upgrade the mise tools only | the tools in the repo's mise files |
| `mise run mise-check:update-packages` | to upgrade the Node packages only | package.json and its lockfile, through aube |
| `mise run mise-check:update-go` | to upgrade Go only | every go.mod's toolchain line and modules, majors too, their import paths rewritten |
| `mise run mise-check:show-users` | to see which of the owner's repos use this one, and which are behind | which of the owner's repos use it, at what version, the behind ones marked |
| `mise run mise-check:template` | only in a repo with no Go program yet | the template's little app, its go.mod and packages; it never writes over a file |
| `mise run mise-check:new-tool` | to start a new mise tool repo, with its binary, template, walks and CI | a new mise tool repo in an empty folder: mise-check at its release, copied and renamed for the module, its packages imported instead |
| `mise run mise-check:show-version` | to say which mise-check this is | its version |
| `mise run mise-check:show-help` | to list every command | every command and its flags |

The four updates take `--no-major` (no major moves) and `--json` (one JSON document on stdout: every pin, its file,
before and after, whether it moved and whether that was a major move; the tools' own output goes to stderr).
`mise run mise-check`, `show`, `check`, `show-users` and `show-version` take `--json` too.
`new-tool` takes the new repo's module, `github.com/<owner>/<name>`, in an empty folder, and `--from <folder>`: copy
that checkout of mise-check instead of its release, to try a change before it is released.

`mise run mise-check:show-users` finds the repos that use this one by their `go.mod` (its Go module) and their mise
files (its binary). It reads them on GitHub, as Go's own index (pkg.go.dev's imported-by) counts no imports from tests, and mise pins aren't in
any index; private repos need a token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `gh auth login`).

`mise run mise-check:verify` is what `.github/workflows/mise-check.yml` runs on GitHub: first each kind of pin checked
consistent with what pins it, as the updates leave them, then the repo's own `setup` and `test` tasks if it has them,
then check.

## Upgrading mise-check

`mise run mise-check:update` moves mise-check with every other pin; then `mise run mise-check:init` writes its files
as the new release does. A pin of `latest` runs the newest release installed on the machine: `mise install` keeps an
older one there, and an update installs the newest.

When the binary is too old to move itself (0.4.29 and older ask mise's versions host, which can say "All tools are up
to date" with a release out), or `check` says the binary is behind go.mod's packages, one line sets the repo up at
any release, whatever is installed:

```sh
mise exec github:joeblew999/mise-check@<release> -- mise-check init
```

It writes mise-check's files as that release does, moves an older pin to it (a pin of `latest` stays, and runs it),
and adds what `.mise/config.toml` lacks of the template's settings.

## What the updates run

`mise run mise-check:update` moves every pin the repo has of its own, each with its own tool (each step below is
also a task of its own: `update-mise`, `update-packages`, `update-go`), and mise reads no
parent folder's config, so nothing outside the repo moves:

1. mise's tools, in the repo's mise files: `mise upgrade --bump --no-global`, after `mise cache clear` of the tools the
   repo takes the minute they're out (the ones its `minimum_release_age_excludes` names, mise-check always among
   them): mise keeps a tool's list of releases an hour, and holds back every other tool's a day. A pin of `latest`
   stays `latest`.
2. its packages, when it has a `package.json`: `aube update --latest`, which writes whichever lockfile the repo has
3. in every `go.mod` of the repo (none in `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `testdata/` or a dot folder):
   - its Go: `go get toolchain@latest`, the toolchain line. The `go` line, the least Go the module needs, stays.
   - its modules: `go mod tidy`, then [go-mod-upgrade](https://github.com/oligot/go-mod-upgrade) `--force`, majors
     too (it rewrites their import paths), then `go mod tidy`. Releases younger than 7 days are skipped.

It ends with every pin, the moved ones before → after, majors marked. `git diff` shows them; `mise run
mise-check:verify` proves them, as a major move can break the repo's own code. mise-check's own pin moves with the
rest: then `mise run mise-check:init` writes its files again. In CI it doesn't run: CI only checks.

go-mod-upgrade skips `// indirect` lines, so the first `go mod tidy` is needed. mise can't write a `go.mod` (its
idiomatic version file for Go), so `update-mise` leaves Go to `update-go`.

What `verify` checks of each kind, so a pin file out of step with the code fails here and on GitHub, and an update
is what fixes it:

| Kind | Moved by | `verify` checks |
|---|---|---|
| mise tools | `update-mise` | nothing more: the mise files pin exact versions, their own lock |
| Node packages | `update-packages` | `aube install --frozen-lockfile`: `package.json` and the lockfile agree |
| Go | `update-go` | `go mod tidy -diff` in every go.mod: go.mod and go.sum are what the imports need |


go-mod-upgrade is pinned once, in mise-check's own root `mise.toml`, and run at that version: the repo needs nothing
of its own for it. A newer mise-check brings a newer go-mod-upgrade.

## Keeping tasks, Go, tests and skills in step: misecheck

A repo with mise-check's binary gets misecheck's rules on its own mise files with no code: `mise run
mise-check:check` runs them on its `mise.toml` and `.mise/tasks/*.toml` (each task one line, usage passed by name, no
POSIX shell syntax). The strict checks, for a repo with a binary of its own (its tasks against its Go, the tests that
run them, and its skill), are a test of your own for each mise file, saying in Go what to check:

```go
func TestRootMise(t *testing.T) { misecheck.Check(t, misecheck.Config{MiseFile: "mise.toml"}) }
```

and a task of your mise file runs that test by name:

```toml
[tasks."root:check-mise"]
run = 'go test . -run "^TestRootMise$" -count=1 -v'
```

| `Config` | What |
|---|---|
| `MiseFile` | The mise file: a `mise.toml`, or a file of tasks only (`.mise/tasks/*.toml`) |
| `GoCmd`, `GoLayout` | For tasks that run binaries of yours: their folder (`<GoCmd>/<binary>/`), and how each binary's commands are laid out, `file` (a file each) or `folder` (a folder each). Both, or neither |
| `GoCallers` | The folder of Go that runs the tasks by name, an end-to-end test say (optional) |
| `GoBinaries` | Which binaries of `GoCmd` to hold to the strict way (optional; none, all of them): for a repo taking it up one binary at a time |
| `Skills` | The agent skill of these tasks, a `SKILL.md`, and any page that must cover them too, your docs (optional): each must name every task and every flag the tasks take, and every task it names must be one, so the skill always covers everything the binary can do |
| `Names` | Other files that name these tasks without covering them all, a hook, a workflow, a config file's comments (optional): every task one names, as `mise run namespace:task` or in full in a namespace of the file, must be one, so none sends a person or an agent to a task that isn't there |

The packages are only the strict checks; the repo uses mise-check itself through mise, as any repo does: `mise-check
init` at its top, and `go.mod` requiring the packages at the release `.mise/config.toml` pins. `Check` holds a repo to
that in its own tests: without mise-check's tasks (`.mise/tasks/mise-check.toml`) it fails with the `mise exec
github:joeblew999/mise-check@<release> -- mise-check init` line to run; with the binary behind the packages, the same
line at the packages' release; with the packages behind, `mise run mise-check:update`, which moves both. A `go get`
of the packages alone is the mistake it catches.

## The end-to-end tests: walk

Your test says only what's yours: the steps (each a task of your mise file, named in full, and what to check after it)
and how a person makes a new repo with your tool. `walk` does the rest: the repo cut off from the repo
around it (its own mise only), its tasks run by name, its setup, the steps in order, the files a step changed,
process groups and Windows' long paths.

```go
var myWalk = walk.Walk[*myRepo]{Steps: steps, New: newRepo, Of: func(r walk.Repo) *myRepo { return &myRepo{r} }}

func TestWalkTemplate(t *testing.T) { myWalk.Template(t, "templates") }
func TestWalkNewRepo(t *testing.T)   { myWalk.NewRepo(t) }
func TestSteps(t *testing.T)         { walk.CheckSteps(t, "templates/.mise/tasks/mytool.toml", steps) }
```

Which repo is the test's name: `Template` walks your template where it is, `NewRepo` a new repo made from nothing by
your `New`. A task of your mise file runs each by name, and a walk runs only when named (`walk.OnlyByName`, which
your own tests that change things can call too), so `go test ./...` never walks:

```toml
[tasks."new-repo:e2e"]
usage = 'flag "--version <version>" help="make it at this release"'
run = 'go test . -run "^TestWalkNewRepo$" -count=1 -v{% if usage.version %} -args -version "{{usage.version}}"{% endif %}'
```

| Test flag | What |
|---|---|
| `-version` | The release a new repo is made at (default this checkout's build) |
| `-stage` | How far to walk, when your steps have stages (default the first) |

For a tool whose steps are numbered in the order a repo takes them (mise-cloudflare's `cloudflare:03-init` to
`15-clean`), `CheckSteps` fails unless your steps are exactly your mise file's numbered tasks, in their order; a tool
with few steps (mise-check's `init`, `check`, `show`) needs no numbers, and no `TestSteps`. Either way, misecheck
(`GoCallers`) checks that every task name your steps use is a task. When the repo walked needs something its own mise
files can't give it, cut off from the repo around it, `Prepare` adds it (mise-check's own gives its template, a folder of
its module with no `go.mod` of its own, that module's Go).

## What misecheck checks, in full

Every task: its `run` and `usage` are each one line; it declares its flags and arguments in mise's `usage` and passes
each by name with mise's templates (`{% if usage.yes %} --yes{% endif %}`); its run has no POSIX shell syntax
(`${…}`, `$name`, `NAME=value cmd`), which Windows' cmd doesn't read.

The Go a task runs: from source (`go run|test|build ./path`, any folder, several) the folder must hold Go, and for
`./...` or `./path/...` Go anywhere below it, as `go test` finds it;
a binary of yours (`<binary> <command>`, built or run as `go tool <binary> <command>`) must have that command, every command must be one a task runs, and every flag
is declared on both sides. Anything else a task runs (`hugo …`, `wrangler …`) is held to the rules every task is, above, and logged as not
checked: a file of only such tool tasks passes on those rules alone, unless it's given `GoCmd` (then its tasks must
run its Go).

A task's `go test -run "^TestX$"` must name a test there is, in the folder it tests: a test renamed, and the task
that runs it says so. Go that runs tasks names each in full (`"namespace:task"`), and every name must be a task. Each
of `Skills` names every task and every flag, and every task it names is one; each of `Names` names only tasks there
are.

Skills: `mise run mise-check:check` holds every skill of the repo, `.claude/skills/<namespace>/SKILL.md`, to the tasks
of that namespace, both ways: it names every task and every flag they take, and every task of the namespace it names
is one. A test of the repo's own gets the same with `misecheck.CheckSkills(t, ".")`.

The full rules are the [package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/joeblew999/mise-check).

## Moving to 0.4.20 or later

0.4.20 dropped the env a repo's tasks used to configure the packages: each repo's tests say it in Go instead.

| Before 0.4.20 | 0.4.20 and later |
|---|---|
| `func TestMise(t *testing.T) { misecheck.Check(t, misecheck.FromEnv()) }`, the task's `env` saying what (`MISE_FILE`, `GO_CMD`, `GO_LAYOUT`, `GO_CALLERS`, `GO_BINARIES`, `SKILL_FILE`) | A test for each mise file, its `misecheck.Config` written there: `func TestRootMise(t *testing.T) { misecheck.Check(t, misecheck.Config{MiseFile: "mise.toml"}) }`, the task running it by name, no `env` |
| `GoBinaries: "a,b"` | `GoBinaries: []string{"a", "b"}`, and `Skills` a list too |
| `func TestWalk(t *testing.T) { w.Run(t) }`, the task's `env` saying which repo (`REPO_PATH`, `E2E_STAMPED`) and how far (`E2E_STAGE`) | A test a kind of repo, run by name: `func TestWalkTemplate(t *testing.T) { w.Template(t, "templates") }`, `func TestWalkNewRepo(t *testing.T) { w.NewRepo(t) }`; how far is the test's flag, `-args -stage deploy` |
| A test the env skipped | `walk.OnlyByName(t)`: it runs only when its task names it, `-run "^TestX$"` |

And misecheck now checks that a task's `go test -run "^TestX$"` names a test there is, so a test renamed and the task
that runs it can't drift.
