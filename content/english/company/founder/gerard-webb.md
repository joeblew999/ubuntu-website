Founder & CEO of Ubuntu Software. 25 years building real-time, distributed systems for global enterprises—from investment banking trading floors to automotive manufacturing lines to government sensor fusion systems.

Now applying that experience to the convergence of AI and 3D design. The goal: bring spatial intelligence capabilities that were once locked in expensive proprietary systems to everyone who works in three dimensions.

**Technical passions:** Go, NATS JetStream, CRDTs, open standards (STEP, IFC), and building systems that work offline-first in real-world conditions.

**Philosophy:** Technology should serve human needs, not the other way around. Open standards beat proprietary lock-in. The best software disappears into the workflow.
