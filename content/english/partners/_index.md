## Sell More Than Hardware

Your customers don't just need drones—they need fleet infrastructure. Navigation, telemetry, coordination, monitoring. The software that makes a drone fleet actually work.

We provide that infrastructure. You sell the hardware. Together, we turn one-time sales into recurring revenue.

---

## How It Works

```
1. Customer buys drone kit from your shop
2. Kit includes credentials for our managed infrastructure
3. Customer's drones connect as leaf nodes to our hubs
4. You earn revenue share on their subscription
5. We handle infrastructure—or you do, your choice
```

**Open hardware, managed infrastructure.** We don't compete with you on hardware sales. We provide the backend that makes your hardware more valuable.
