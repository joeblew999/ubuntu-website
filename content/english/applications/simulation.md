## Where AI Learns to Understand and Create in Three Dimensions

Before a robot touches the real world, it lives in simulation. Before an autonomous vehicle navigates a city, it drives millions of miles in synthetic environments. Before embodied AI can act, it must learn.

Simulation is the training ground. We're building the infrastructure.

---

## The Reality Gap

**AI is hungry for data. But physical-world data is:**

- **Expensive.** Every real-world test costs time, equipment, and risk.
- **Slow.** You can't run a million trials overnight in a physical warehouse.
- **Dangerous.** Crashes, collisions, and failures have real consequences.
- **Limited.** You can't manufacture edge cases on demand.

Simulation solves this—if the simulation is good enough.

The challenge isn't building a game engine. It's building environments that transfer to reality. Synthetic data that trains models that actually work.

That requires native 3D understanding. Not rendering. **Understanding.**

---

## What We Enable

### Synthetic Environment Generation

**AI that designs the worlds AI trains in.**

Not hand-crafted levels. Not artist-built scenes. AI-generated environments with:

- **Procedural variation** — Infinite configurations from parametric rules
- **Semantic richness** — Objects with meaning, not just geometry
- **Physical accuracy** — Materials, friction, mass, dynamics that match reality
- **Edge case generation** — Deliberately create the scenarios that break models

Design a warehouse template. Generate ten thousand variations. Train on all of them.

---

### Synthetic Data at Scale

**Training data without the labeling bottleneck.**

When you own the simulation, you own the ground truth:

- **Perfect annotations** — Every pixel labeled, every object tracked
- **Sensor simulation** — Cameras, LiDAR, depth sensors, radar
- **Domain randomization** — Vary lighting, textures, positions systematically
- **Failure injection** — Simulate sensor noise, occlusion, adversarial conditions

No manual labeling. No annotation errors. Unlimited volume.

---

### Physics-Based Simulation

**Reality has physics. Your simulation must too.**

NATS JetStream architecture enables:

- **Distributed physics** — Scale simulation across compute clusters
- **Real-time and faster** — Train at 1000x real-time when you can
- **Accurate dynamics** — Rigid body, soft body, fluids, cables
- **Contact modeling** — Grasping, manipulation, assembly that transfers to real robots

Simulation that lies to your AI produces AI that fails in reality.

---

### Reinforcement Learning Environments

**The gym for embodied AI.**

- **Customizable task spaces** — Define objectives, rewards, success criteria
- **Curriculum generation** — Progressive difficulty, automated
- **Parallel rollouts** — Thousands of agents training simultaneously
- **State inspection** — Full observability for debugging and analysis

Your RL agents need environments designed for learning, not just visualization.

---

### Sim-to-Real Pipeline

**The gap between simulation and reality is where projects die.**

Close it with:

- **Digital twin calibration** — Tune simulation to match real-world measurements
- **Reality capture integration** — Scan physical spaces into simulation
- **Transfer learning validation** — Test synthetic-trained models against real data
- **Continuous refinement** — Production data flows back to improve simulation

Not simulation OR reality. **Simulation TO reality.**

---

### Open Standards

**Your training environments shouldn't be locked in a game engine.**

STEP geometry means:

- Import CAD from any source
- Export environments to any simulator
- Maintain engineering precision, not game-engine approximations
- Archive training environments for reproducibility

Simulation built on open standards. Training data you actually own.

---

## Use Cases

### Autonomous Vehicles

Millions of miles of synthetic driving. Every weather condition. Every edge case. Every near-miss scenario you can imagine—and many you can't.

- Urban environments at scale
- Sensor simulation for full stack testing
- Scenario generation for safety validation
- Synthetic data for perception training

---

### Robotics Training

Teach robots manipulation, navigation, and interaction without destroying hardware.

- Grasping and manipulation tasks
- Mobile robot navigation
- Multi-robot coordination
- Human-robot interaction scenarios

---

### Humanoid Development

Before your humanoid walks in a factory, it walks in simulation. Before it hands a tool to a human, it learns the motion synthetically.

- Locomotion training across terrain types
- Manipulation skill learning
- Human collaboration scenarios
- Fall recovery and edge case handling

---

### Warehouse & Logistics

Optimize layouts and train systems before building.

- Goods-to-person system simulation
- Traffic flow optimization
- Pick-and-place training data
- Throughput prediction

---

### Industrial Digital Twins

Mirror your facility. Train against it. Optimize it.

- Factory floor simulation
- Process optimization
- Predictive maintenance training
- What-if scenario analysis

---

## For AI Teams

**Training embodied AI?** You need environments that:

- Generate unlimited variations
- Produce perfect ground truth labels
- Scale across your compute infrastructure
- Transfer to the real world

Stop building custom simulation infrastructure. Build on ours.

---

## For Robotics Companies

**Your robots need to train before they ship.**

- Accelerate development cycles
- Reduce physical prototype costs
- Catch failures before customers do
- Generate training data continuously

Simulation as competitive advantage.

---

## For Autonomous Systems

**Vehicles, drones, mobile robots—anything that moves needs simulation.**

- Safety validation at scale
- Edge case coverage
- Regulatory compliance evidence
- Continuous improvement pipeline

Prove safety before deployment.

---

## The Numbers

**Real-world testing:**

- $1000s per hour of operation
- Days to set up scenarios
- One crash = weeks of delay

**Simulation:**

- Marginal cost approaching zero
- Millions of scenarios overnight
- Failures are data, not disasters

The math is obvious. The infrastructure is what's been missing.

## Get Started

Every AI that will act in the physical world needs to learn in simulation first.

We're building where that learning happens.
